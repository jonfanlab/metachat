# A multi-agentic framework for real-time, autonomous freeform metasurface design

**Preprint:** [arXiv:2503.20479](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.20479)

This repository is a placeholder for the code accompanying our study, **[A multi-agentic framework for real-time, autonomous freeform metasurface design](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.20479)**, which is currently under peer review. We will populate this repository upon completion of the review process.

## Overview

We present *MetaChat*, a multi-agentic computer-aided design framework, which combines agency with millisecond-speed deep learning surrogate solvers to automate and accelerate photonics design. MetaChat is capable of performing complex freeform design tasks in nearly real-time, as opposed to the days-to-weeks required by the manual use of conventional computing methods and resources.

Near real-time, multi-objective, multi-wavelength autonomous metasurface design is enabled by two key contributions:
- **Agentic Iterative Monologue (AIM):** *A novel agentic system designed to seamlessly automate multiple-agent collaboration, human-designer interaction, and computational tools*
- **FiLM WaveY-Net:** *A semi-general fullwave surrogate solver, which supports conditional fullwave modeling—enabling simulations with variable conditions, including source angle, wavelength, material, and device topology—while maintaining high fidelity to the governing physics*
